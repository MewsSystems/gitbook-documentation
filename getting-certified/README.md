# Getting certified

Once the development and testing of your integration is complete, you will need to be certified, this is simply to confirm that the integration works as expected and respects the guidelines for the API.
Once certified, your solution can join the [Mews Marketplace](../mews-marketplace/README.md), your ultimate goal for future revenue generation.

The certification process is as follows:
