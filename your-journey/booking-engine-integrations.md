# Booking Engine integrations

The steps for a Booking Engine API integration are as follows:

* [Step 1: Explore the API](#step-1-exploration)
* [Step 2: Develop and test your solution](#step-2-development)
* [Step 3: Register with us](#step-3-registration)

If you have questions about the process, drop us a line to [partnersuccess@mews.com](mailto:partnersuccess@mews.com).

## Step 1: Exploration

Explore the [Booking Engine Guide](https://mews-systems.gitbook.io/booking-engine-guide/) and familiarize yourself with the API guidelines and operations.
Not sure if the API is the right option? See [Booking Engine Guide ways to integrate](https://mews-systems.gitbook.io/booking-engine-guide/faq/ways-to-integrate).

> Please note that connection to the Booking Engine API is only available to Mews customers with Enterprise packages.

## Step 2: Development

When you've decided which API operations to use and how, you'll see the API has its own demo credentials for you to try them out, connecting to our demo servers.
All of the information you need to start developing and testing is in the documentation.

## Step 3: Registration

When you are finished developing and testing, please register your client name and other details with Mews, as described in [Booking Engine API authorization](https://mews-systems.gitbook.io/booking-engine-guide/booking-engine-api/guidelines/authorization).
To do so, send an email to [support@mews.com](mailto:support@mews.com) like the following example. Once registered, you're all done!
